# Employee-Tracker
An SQL app designed to manage the entire staff body of a make-believe company

## Installation
Download the app from GitHub, open in VSCode, use "npm start", and the app will begin

## Usage
Upon opening, you will be greeted with a few options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, update an employee role, or exit.  Selecting anything with "view" will populate a table displaying all members of whatever specific query you're inquiring about (departments, roles, and employees).  Selecting "add" will simply push another user-input employee, department, or role to the DB.  This will help higher-level employees get a bird's-eye-view of their entire company structure.
